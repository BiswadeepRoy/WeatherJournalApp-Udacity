# Weather-Journal App Project

# Overview
This project demonstrates the use of asynchronous javascripts and use of fetch API to fetch external resources as well.
It also deals with the client-server system made through javascript and the use of async functions, await and fetch functions as well as promise chaining.

# Instructions
To run this application the user would need to enter any US based postal codes and some thoughts or message to be printed as Blog, on entering the call to the OpenWeather API will be made and the current temparature will be generated and fetched on the client and rendered onto the screen along with the date and the user input in the thoughts or message.

### OpenWeatherAPI
OpenWeatherAPI is an online free API which on requesting with a valid postal code will generate a sample response containing the temparature in the payload. More information will be found at https://openweathermap.org/api
